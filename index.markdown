![Taxonomy of of certifiably robust approaches against \\(\ell_p\\) adversary. Full details available in SoK](/assets/AVR-taxonomy-new.png)

This is the accompanying website of [SoK: Towards Effective Automated Vulnerability Repair](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity25-li-ying.pdf).


<!-- This website provides [**full benchmark results**](/benchmark) and  blablabla. -->

<!-- **Benchmark**: In the benchmark page, we provide **current status for vulnerability Patching dataset** along with details for each vulnerability & fixes dataset, and why (not) could be applied to AVR.  -->

**Tools**: We provide current AVR tools status and summarize issues in open source. Also, we provide recommendations for good practice

**Case Studies**: In the case studies page, we provide the analysis of some extended cases and the reason why/why not be repaired.


<!-- **Additional Conclusions**:  -->
