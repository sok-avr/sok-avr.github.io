<p>This is the accompying website of [SoK: Towards Effective Automated Vulnerability Repair].</p>

<!-- This website provides [**full benchmark results**](/benchmark) and  blablabla. -->

<!-- **Benchmark**: In the benchmark page, we provide **current status for vulnerability Patching dataset** along with details for each vulnerability & fixes dataset, and why (not) could be applied to AVR.  -->

<p><strong>Tools</strong>: We provide current AVR tools status and summarize issues in open source. Also, we provide recommendations for good practice</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong>: In the case studies page, we provide the analysis of some extended cases and the reason why/why not be repaired.</p>

<!-- **Additional Conclusions**:  -->
