## Summarized cases that learning-based methods can repair

**1. For vulnerabilities with explicit patterns(e.g., security usage of APIs)**

```diff

```
The LLM generate this fix because such patterns often involve widely recommended best practices, such as replacing `Random` with `SecureRandom` in security-sensitive contexts. Also, such fix don't need to consider too much about the dependencies. VUL4J-71 is also such a repair.

VUL4J-51 is also similar:

**2. Built-in Features**

        while (nextEntry != null) {
            File f = new File(targetDirectory, nextEntry.getName());

```

Analysis: `targetDirectory.getCanonicalPath()` was used to get the canonical path of the target directory, but the path was directly concatenated with the file name without ensuring there was a proper path separator(`\` or `/`), if the `targetDirectory` path did not end with a separator, this could lead to incorrect file paths, potentially causing exceptions or even security risks such as directory traversal attacks. The fix involved appending `File.separatorChar` to the canonical path of targetDirectory. The fix is related to Javaâ€™s built-in features `File.separatorChar`, for LLMs such explicit features that related to built-feature/library sometimes is easy to be fixed. But also due to such explicit pattern, for deep learning or other methods, they are also easy to be fixed.

VUL4J-79(CVE-2018-1002201) is also similar cases:

**3. Simple changes, short context**

For example, [CVE-2018-17202](https://github.com/apache/commons-imaging/commit/6a79d35d6654d895d0a4b73b3a9282ec9aaeeb06):

Analysis: The change mainly transform the `while` loop to `if` condition, This could be repaired by GPT4, CodeT5, and Fine-tuned Incoder.  In the original code, if the input parameter `v` is very small, then `while (v < vt)` may always be `true`, potentially cause infinit loop. So make this simple change. However, the root cause of this vulnerability is mainly the **misunderstanding of [JEPG Sign Extension Standard Section F2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf)**, where the specification means *Each decoded value needs to be sign-extended **at most once***. Whereas this constraint should be get from *Figure F.12* in the specification. However, even though the models describe above have fixed this, this may because the fix is not complex, and when given the CWE type in the prompt, such fix could be guessed successfully. If there are very long context, the models may not take effective. In this case, we advocate **Better specification Genration**, from the document, the expression are diverse, figures, text, etc. Better specification with the vulnerable code will be better for LLM driven AVR.

[Vul4J-20](https://github.com/apache/commons-imaging/commit/6a79d35d6654d895d0a4b73b3a9282ec9aaeeb06)(CVE-2018-11797) also belongs to this type **Simple changes, short context**, which can be repaired by GPT-4 in our experiment

## Summarized cases that learning-based methods cannot repair

**1. The vulerability fix should take logic into consideration, however, learning based methods know nothing about with the specification of the vul**

```diff
//CVE-2019-3775
@@ -38,6 +38,10 @@ public boolean isAllowed(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {

        if (!scimUserFromDb.getUserName().equals(scimUserFromRequest.getUserName())) {
            return false;
        }
```

Analysis: This vulnerability is due to improper authentication. This patch adds email validation logic to prevent users from updating their email addresses themselves, thereby increasing the security of the system and ensuring that email changes must be performed by authorized entities. However, for learning-based methods, they lack the understanding of the whole code intention, and specifications for this logic. So it is almost impossible for it to implement such fix.

**2. The fix need to consider about inter-procedural dependency**

```diff

        }

        void clear(Calendar c) {
```
Analysis:
`Math.min(i - offset, c.getActualMaximum(field))` is used to ensure that calculations or value settings do not exceed the allowed boundaries, the system can prevent endless loops. However, for learning based methods, they don't know the restriction, and also which function could be called to fix it, i.e., lack understanding for code dependency and logic.

**3. Single Line Change does not mean simple change**

```diff

Analysis: Feeding XStream with specially crafted XML can cause the JVM to crash, leading to a Denial of Service DoS attack. This occurs when the XML contains type information that directs XStream to create an instance of the **primitive void** type, which cannot have instances. So the fix is to explicitly blocks XStream from handling `void.class` and `Void.class`.  Though the fix is only one line, if the **root cause** of this vulnerability is unclear, even though feed LLMs with vulnerable function, fix location, and CWE type, it's still not helpful.

## Summarized cases that non-learning-based methods can repair

> The types of vulnerabilities that can be repaired by non-learning-based methods depend on the design of these methods, which are more transparent than learning-based methods. Here, we only list some cases where non-learning-based methods can repair vulnerabilities but learning-based methods cannot.

**1. Dependent with Macros, global variables, unobtainable structure members, etc.**

- Case 1: CVE-2012-2806

```diff
@@ -323,14 +323,15 @@ get_sos (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)

	    ci++, compptr++) {
      if (cc == compptr->component_id && !cinfo->cur_comp_info[ci])
	goto id_found;
```

Analysis: The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `cinfo->num_components` as the loop boundary without validation. This value, provided by the input JPEG file, is potentially be set to an arbitrary number. Consequently, the loop might iterate beyond the bounds of allocated memory, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. To repair this vulnerability, it needs to take the macro `MAX_COMPS_IN_SCAN` into consideration, which defines the maxium number of components the program can safely handle.  Changing the loop condition accordingly prevents overflow. While learning-based methods miss such critical macros. The non-learning based methods can synthesize correct patch with the correct constraint extracted during fuzzing. 

Case-2: [CVE-2016-8691](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/d8c2604cd438c41ec72aff52c16ebd8183068020)

+		}
		siz->comps[i].sgnd = (tmp >> 7) & 1;
		siz->comps[i].prec = (tmp & 0x7f) + 1;
	}
```

Analysis: The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of boundary checks for the horizontal sampling factor (hsamp) and vertical sampling factor (vsamp). If there is not such check, the value could be 0 or greater than 255, may leading to division by zero and application crash. To fix this, the member in structure `jpc_siz_t`and `jpc_sizcomp_t` must be considered, otherwise, it is possible for a correct repair. For learning based methods, only with a vulnerable function takes no effect. For non-learning based methods, e.g., Vulnfix, according to fuzzing, to extract invariant, constraint, which take the necessary dependency into consideration, performing a correct repair.

```
In this case, the vulnerability fix is a single-hunk fix and only has two lines of code addition. However, it **cannot be repaired by both learning and non-learning methods**. The root of the vulnerability lies in the reliance on the cached value of `td->td_nstrips`, This value is calculated when the strip count is first needed, based on the image's length and the rows per strip. However, if the structure of the image changes afterward in another function, the cached value becomes outdated, leading to inconsistencies. The vulnerability emerges because there is no mechanism to ensure that the cached. `td->td_nstrips` value is updated when the underlying image structure changes. For learning-based methods, it has no context, no information about the `td` member, and unclear about the root cause of this vulnerability, so it's hard to repair. For non-learning based methods, wrong constraints, and wrong localization lead to no successul repair. As analyzed in this case, although the change is 2 lines of code, it still has a complex logic.




## Summary
1. Though very simple changes, the vulnerability logic could be very complex. So in this case, it is hard to fix by both learning and non-learning based methods. The focus should be on how to determine the root cause of the vulnerability, and for constraints, invariants inference, etc, instead of totally rely on learning based methods in the first step, because in most situation, they only have limited context.
2. The vulnerability on C/C++ in more on memory bugs, however, for Java, it's a memory-safe language, most of its vulnerability are on the application-layer, could have more logic vulnerability, which has low RSR(as shown in our paper).
3. In AVR, there is currently no method that has an absolute advantage. 


## Hybrid approach will enhance AVR

For exmaple, `CVE-2022-1674`
This vulnerability could not be repair by SOTA NPDs repair tool [CONCH](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-xing-yunlong.pdf) due to *Unobtainable Member*, when directly feed this into LLM with CWE type, fix location, vulnerable function, it could not be repaired, either. However, when given the structure of regmatch_T. LLM(specifically, gpt-4) could perform a correct repair.  So in this case, the thing we should do is to use like program analysis to obtain its structure, and together with LLM to fix. Similar cases that we mentioned above could also be repaired using this.

Except static program analysis, other dynamic analysis could also be used, like fuzzing, we could extract the constraint from the trace. 

Also, other information, e.g., specifications, code comments may also be helpful to fix the vulnerability(Please see what we discussed in paper in Section 5.2).
